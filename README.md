# Web Application Exercise

A little exercise to build a web application following an agile development process. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Product Vision Statement

A minimalist and intuitive to-do list app designed for simple and quick task management.

## User stories

- As a student, I want to sign up so I can track my to-do.
- As a developer, I want to edit so I can be flexible with my to-do.
- As a professor, I want to delete so I can remove to-dos that are no longer relevant.
- As an enterpreneur, I want to finish so I can list my to-do as done and feel good about it.
- As a busy CEO, I want to search so I can remember my to-do.
- As a writer, I want to see a display of my to-do so I can visualize my progress.
- As a non-tech savvy user, I want a simple interface so I can easily use the app.
- As a teacher, I want to prioritize tasks, so I can focus on the most important ones first.

## Screens

1. **Login Screen:**

4. **Add Todo Screen:**

   - **Purpose:** Allow the user to add a new todo.
   - **Database Interaction:** Inserts new data into the database.
   - Endpoints:
     - POST /todos

5. **Edit/Delete Todo Screen:**

- Endpoints:
    - PUT /todos/<id>
    - DELETE /todos/<id>

6. **Search Screen:**
   - **Purpose:** Allow the user to search for todos using keywords or deadlines.
