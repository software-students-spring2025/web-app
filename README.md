A little exercise to build a web application following an agile development process. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Product vision statement

## User stories

[User Stories](https://github.com/software-students-spring2025/2-web-app-web-surfer/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22User%20Stories%22)

- As an admin, I can moderate and remove fraudulent or misleading listings, so that the platform remains reliable for users.
- As a student, I can search all available rental buildings around my university, so that I can choose my preferred ones to reduce the commute time.
- As a guest, I can search up a specific building for its availability, so that I have the availability of that building and can compare the price with other buildings.
- As a guest, I can view all prices of a specific apartment on the website, so that I know the price of the apartments available in the area.
- As a tenant, I want to compare the prices of similar properties on the website, so that I can assess if I am overpaying and negotiate better with my landlord.
- As a landlord, I want to compare rental prices of similar properties in my area on the website, so that I can accurately price my rental.

   - Package room, parking, concierge, library

7. **Wishlist**:
   - References to user and house

#### Data Flow

- When an admin creates or updates an apartment, the data is stored in the houses collection along with references to associated policies, features, and amenities.
- When a guest adds an apartment to their wishlist, a new entry is created in the wishlists collection with references to both the user and the apartment.

### Troubleshooting

- **Login Issues**: Ensure that the MongoDB service is running and that your credentials are correct.
- **Missing Dependencies**: Run `pip install flask flask-jwt-extended pymongo mongoengine python-dotenv` to install all required packages.
- **Database Connection**: Verify that the MongoDB connection string in the `.env` file is correct.
- **Page Not Found**: Ensure you're using the correct routes as defined in the application.

### Security Notes

- The application uses JWT for authentication
- Passwords should be properly hashed in a production environment
- Environment variables should be properly secured
